core: pin the bundled Bun runtime to 1.4.0 and restore streamed request bodies through HTTP proxies. Bun 1.4.0 ships the `fetch` + `proxy` `ReadableStream` body fix, so `createProxyFetch` no longer buffers the request. Plugin runtime compatibility is now Bun `>=1.4.0`. Compiled macOS binaries are ad-hoc re-signed after `bun build --compile` so they launch on macOS 27. Release runs on macOS so that signature is applied when the CLI is actually published.
