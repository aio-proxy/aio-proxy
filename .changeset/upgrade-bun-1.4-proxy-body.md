core: upgrade the bundled Bun runtime to the 1.4 line so proxied streaming passthrough no longer drops the request body. Bun 1.3.x silently discarded a `ReadableStream` request body when `fetch` used a proxy, so `api` providers with a `proxy` configured hung until timeout on streaming requests (e.g. `openai-response` passthrough). The compiled binary embeds the build-time Bun runtime, so this is delivered by pinning the build toolchain to Bun 1.4.
