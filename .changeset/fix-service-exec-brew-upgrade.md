cli: fix the managed service becoming unreachable after `brew upgrade`. The service unit now records the stable PATH launcher instead of the version-pinned Cellar binary, `service restart` regenerates an already-installed unit with a freshly resolved executable (recovering units that still point at a deleted old binary), and `resolveExec` falls back to the PATH launcher when the running executable was deleted mid-upgrade. `aio-proxy upgrade` now always restarts a managed daemon after upgrading (the `--restart` flag is removed); a manually started daemon still gets a self-restart hint.
