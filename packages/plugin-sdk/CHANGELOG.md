## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- [#203](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/pull/203) [`076c67b`](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/commit/076c67ba698c4cd7a3756ef370adc7a62a530402) Thanks [@baranwang](https://github.com/baranwang)! - Add `aio-proxy provider import [path]` to copy supported CPA OAuth auth files into aio-proxy accounts. OAuth plugins can declare typed CPA credential importers through the plugin SDK, and the built-in ChatGPT, Google Antigravity, Kimi Code, and xAI Grok plugins now provide them.

### Minor Changes

- [#189](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/pull/189) [`87126aa`](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/commit/87126aadb95151258c8d1a4e52e0f3e854ee0e54) Thanks [@baranwang](https://github.com/baranwang)! - Generate Antigravity default aliases from live model discovery and insert newly seen logical ids on refresh.

  Skip same-wire aliases that only restate one model at every effort. When a family also has a colliding `-tiered` wire, default the alias there and send `xhigh` to it instead of hiding that id. Merge leftover `-thinking` siblings onto `when.thinking` even if the picker omitted them.

  Accept object-form `alias.variants` on read, then store only `{ when, model, preserve }` rows. Unpreserved variant targets stay hidden from the client model list.

- [#187](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/pull/187) [`e770d49`](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/commit/e770d49dc76fb2036a07fc948cba243f49edcd2b) Thanks [@baranwang](https://github.com/baranwang)! - Add managed OpenCode, Pi, and oh-my-pi Agent integrations. Configure them with `aio-proxy agent configure` (floors: OpenCode 1.17.10, Pi 0.84.2, oh-my-pi 17.3.7; login with `opencode auth login --provider aio-proxy` or `/login aio-proxy`). `aio-proxy upgrade` refreshes managed adapters; reload or restart the Agent after configure or upgrade. Exact string KPI values no longer lose visible precision. The plugin SDK descriptor contract, brand, and host accepted version are restored to v1; v2 descriptors are rejected. The xAI artifact smoke gate now follows plugin API v1.

### Patch Changes

- [#188](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/pull/188) [`4bddead`](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/commit/4bddead355c37861e89dd57cf2a6a3514d4b35dc) Thanks [@baranwang](https://github.com/baranwang)! - core: pin the bundled Bun runtime to 1.4.0 and restore streamed request bodies through HTTP proxies. Bun 1.4.0 ships the `fetch` + `proxy` `ReadableStream` body fix, so `createProxyFetch` no longer buffers the request. Plugin runtime compatibility is now Bun `>=1.4.0`. Compiled macOS binaries are ad-hoc re-signed after `bun build --compile` so they launch on macOS 27. Release runs on macOS so that signature is applied when the CLI is actually published.

- [#184](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/pull/184) [`9b6f0a3`](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/commit/9b6f0a3f26d6bb22fc20298dc203825dca818309) Thanks [@baranwang](https://github.com/baranwang)! - Cursor first-login now writes family aliases from AvailableModels, so clients can request names like `claude-sonnet-4-6` / `grok-4.6` and match thinking, effort, and speed onto the live wire slug.

Add Cursor account OAuth/provider support. Normalize OpenAI Responses errors to `response.failed` for Codex.
