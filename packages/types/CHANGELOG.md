### Minor Changes

- [#175](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/pull/175) [`a218496`](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/commit/a218496f461450d1e87757c2aed9770e75b9a6e5) Thanks [@baranwang](https://github.com/baranwang)! - Accept Anthropic requests that combine disabled thinking with `output_config.effort`. Keep slow models.dev refreshes off the startup path. Resolve model metadata per source (config overrides catalogs). Fix overview day ranges to read `usage_daily` instead of pruned spans.

Add Cursor account OAuth/provider support. Normalize OpenAI Responses errors to `response.failed` for Codex.

### Minor Changes

- [#135](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/pull/135) [`f15d8d3`](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/commit/f15d8d301a2172eff687bd414cc9a05b7cab4085) Thanks [@baranwang](https://github.com/baranwang)! - feat: per-provider model metadata & cost overrides

  Providers can now declare a `metadata` map keyed by upstream model id to override client-facing model metadata (name, description, token limits, capabilities) and cost accounting. User config wins over models.dev auto-discovery. Billing uses the actual hit channel's configured `cost`, and each usage row records its `priceSource` (`config`/`models-dev`/`default`). A new `router.modelContextAggregation` (`min` default / `max`) reconciles the context window when multiple providers expose the same public model.

- [#135](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/pull/135) [`6963859`](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/commit/6963859bed52fbb6e56060015bf37c97a9f0abfd) Thanks [@baranwang](https://github.com/baranwang)! - feat: meter image, web-search, and audio usage for per-event and audio fees

  The proxy now counts generated images and web-search invocations from served
  responses (OpenAI Responses output items and streamed AI SDK file/tool-call
  parts) and reads audio token counts from OpenAI-compatible usage. These flow
  into the configured `cost` fields (`image`, `webSearch`, `inputAudio`,
  `outputAudio`), which previously had no effect because nothing produced the
  counts. Audio tokens are treated as a subset of their input/output totals (as
  the upstream reports them) and peeled out before the text rate applies, so each
  audio token is billed once at the audio rate rather than at both rates.
  Requests without such events are unaffected.

### Patch Changes

- [#135](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/pull/135) [`abf31a4`](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/commit/abf31a4c2eaa5c6fedf7dd9831f00e54d2fef8ee) Thanks [@baranwang](https://github.com/baranwang)! - Fix model-metadata projection and billing gaps:

  - `/v1/models` now reflects per-provider config metadata overrides — capabilities,
    `limit.output` (max tokens), and modalities — not just the display name and
    context window. Metadata inherited via `extend` surfaces the same way.
  - `max_input_tokens` now reports the model's maximum input tokens
    (`limit.input`) rather than the total context window, so a model whose context
    window exceeds its input limit no longer over-advertises its input capacity.
  - A flat per-request fee (`cost.request`) is now billed on a successful response
    that carries no token usage, instead of being silently dropped.
  - The generated config JSON Schema references the models.dev model-id enum for
    `metadata.extend`, so editors can autocomplete and validate the slug.
