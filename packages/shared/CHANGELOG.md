### Patch Changes

- [#228](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/pull/228) [`2cb5333`](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/commit/2cb5333493e582b676e34565246cfa0defb24dca) Thanks [@baranwang](https://github.com/baranwang)! - Upgrade Zod to 4.5 and compile inbound protocol request schemas with `z.compile()` (except OpenAI Responses, whose unknown-item transform logs). Upgrade es-toolkit to 1.52. Use `isPlainObject` for JSON and other plain data. Structural plugin/SDK contracts that may be class instances use `isRecord` from the published `@aio-proxy/shared` leaf package. Replace spread-Set arrays with `uniq` in packages that already depend on es-toolkit.
