# aio-proxy

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#117](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/pull/117) [`55d3ccd`](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/commit/55d3ccd49cb6819b8a413050a7a668efc9df17c0) Thanks [@baranwang](https://github.com/baranwang)! - cli: publish a multi-arch (amd64/arm64) Docker image to GHCR on release, and add a Dockerfile and docker-compose example for running aio-proxy in a container

### Patch Changes

- [#120](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/pull/120) [`38960fd`](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/commit/38960fd9fca94d3e38cb5277a5eb928a3962d96a) Thanks [@baranwang](https://github.com/baranwang)! - core: accept `role: "system"` messages on the Anthropic Messages endpoint (matching the official SDK's `MessageParam` union) and surface Zod validation path detail in 400 responses without leaking request values

- [#116](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/pull/116) [`5a6deb7`](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/commit/5a6deb759ed7c748369db2dee814d2686dcd2e8d) Thanks [@baranwang](https://github.com/baranwang)! - server: end streamed request traces at the upstream terminal frame instead of socket EOF, so traces no longer stay "running" after the model finished. Raw passthrough resolves completion at the terminal frame across all four protocols and the AI SDK path at the finish part, without ending the client stream. Adds a configurable upstream idle timeout (300s default) that cancels a stalled upstream and errors the client stream rather than closing it cleanly. OpenAI-compatible passthrough treats [DONE] (not finish_reason) as terminal so trailing include_usage accounting is still captured; session commit stays gated on true stream EOF.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- [#114](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/pull/114) [`23457e3`](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/commit/23457e3c2a4f306460a25aa6252e477f3bbec6ec) Thanks [@baranwang](https://github.com/baranwang)! - release: verify the end-to-end publish + single `v<version>` tag + GitHub Release flow. No user-facing behavior change.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#109](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/pull/109) [`2fdb662`](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/commit/2fdb662f1449087dac370988e41793760b3c4c53) Thanks [@baranwang](https://github.com/baranwang)! - cli: add a `dashboard` command that probes the running daemon and opens the web dashboard in the default browser, resolving host/port via the same control-plane logic as `status`/`doctor` (with `--host`/`--port` overrides). Exits nonzero without opening a browser when the daemon is unreachable.

Package-manager channels re-install a registry-pinned `pkg@version`; the binary channel does an atomic self-replace with `--version` verification, automatic rollback, and backup sweep. Supports `--check`, `--force`, `--restart`, and `--registry`, and hints to restart a running daemon.

### Patch Changes

- [#109](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/pull/109) [`2fdb662`](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/commit/2fdb662f1449087dac370988e41793760b3c4c53) Thanks [@baranwang](https://github.com/baranwang)! - ingress: tolerate unknown `detail` values on OpenAI Responses `input_image` parts. Clients such as Codex send `detail: "original"`, which previously failed the input-item union and rejected the whole request with `400 Invalid OpenAI Responses request` before any provider routing. Unrecognized values are now coerced to `undefined` (a best-effort hint), matching how downstream code already treats `detail`.
